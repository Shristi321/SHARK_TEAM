This is a combined game of three different games: Rock-Paper-Scissor, Cobbman(Similar to Pacman), 
and Popping Cob (a new random game). I was in a group with Rita Adejudge, Kinsey Younggren, and Ashwin Stratton, 
from the Department of Computer Science at Concordia College. The game, Rock-Paper-Scissor, allows users to choose between rock, paper or scissors and 
compare it with a randomly-generated option. The user must play the game unless they win, and after winning the game, you move to Popping Cob. 
In Popping Cob, you need to find a small point in the frame. As you get closer to the point in the frame, the frame will turn red, 
and as you get further away, it will turn blue. The next game is Cobbman, which is a simplified version of Pacman. It allows users to move 
the Cobbman in the desired direction taking the Key Events from the user. The user wins the game if the score is greater than 5,000. 

There is also a use of intermission class for the intermediate screen between each game.
